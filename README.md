## Task 1:

You are given a starter template with dummy data. Add interactivity to the app by refactoring the static code in this template. The goal is to build a React app that shows two chat windows for the two existing users: Amy and John. The messages they send to each other should appear in both chat windows.

- On Amy's screen, her messages should appear in green and John's messages should appear in blue.
- On John's screen, his messages should appear in green and Amy's messages should appear in blue.

## Task 2:

Create a game that displays an equation of the form X+Y+Z=P. Note that X, Y, and Z represent random numbers, and P represents the proposed answer. The user should be able to answer whether it is true that the sum of X, Y, and Z equals the proposed answer P.

The user gets a point for each question they answer correctly. The score is displayed in this format: [number of correct answers]/[number of questions answered]. Every time the user answers a question, a new question that uses randomly generated numbers is displayed.

# Hint

Whenever the game initializes, it should create a new question (i.e., equation) to display to the user. Which hook can you leverage to run this effect?
